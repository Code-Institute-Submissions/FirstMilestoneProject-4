# Piece Of Cake

A Website for the cake lovers needing pre-made custom designs or to have a completely origninal design made for them.

## UX 

The UX thought process behind this is to have a litle steps for the user as possible. 

When searching for a cake thhe user will typiclly have a cake idea already in mind. ( Birthday, Halloween, ect.)

So with a small summary of the cakes on the home page and each type of cake having their own section from the user to choose from. with birthdays being the first since theyre the most sought after. 

## Features

Allows  the users to see the range of cakes on offer 

Allows the user to request a cake already made or a completely custom one via the contact section 

### Future Features 
 For future ideas could be to have a create a cake section using JS to completely customize and build your own cake there on the website. 

 As well as having a shopping cart for users to buy products

## Testing 

First i was solo testing making sure all the links worked all mages were correctly sixed and positioned, testing to make sure the forms wouldnt accept entries without all text filled and email requiring an email address

Second, i used google lighthouse to help and find faults, and fixing the ones i could. 
( i tried to change the images from jpg to jp2 but had trouble with it, inlcuding on the github page as well as on my computer, i then tried with webp and has the same result.)

Third i used css and html validator. Theres one fault were it says the code wont work for the css file 
(
    display: none; 
    float: right;
)
but infact, it still has the desired result.


I made sure the website works on all cdevices with the content re-arranging to display nicer with each different device. Using both browser viewer in VS and Inspect / Develpor Tools on google. 

## Deployment 

To deploy the page, I linked Visual Studio Code to my github, commiting everytime I had a desired outcome for the task at hand i was working towards and pushing it to git every so often so i could use other devices myself to check the results.
